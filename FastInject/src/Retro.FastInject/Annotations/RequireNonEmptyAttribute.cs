/// This attribute can be applied to method parameters to enforce that the corresponding

/// has this attribute and the associated collection is empty, the resolution process
/// may fail based on the logic implemented in the consuming application.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// This attribute is commonly used in conjunction with dependency injection to ensure
